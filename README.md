👋Hello! It’s the Narrator here! This is the tale of Duckalina, a first-year CS major at the Georgia Ducks of Duckology! 🖥️

## 💁 What is Beak-a-Boo? 

Beak-a-Boo is a Google Chrome extension that acts as a study break timer. The user inputs an amount of time they want to study for before taking a break. Once the timer reaches 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds, Duckalina will pop up on the user's screen and remind the user to take a 10 minute study/work break! When the user is ready, the user can click on a "freeze cursor" button that will prevent users from moving their cursor (unless they press the ESC key to exit out of the break timer early). This encourages users to take a break from their screen and get active!

* A timer that counts down from some user-inputted amount of time
* A cool, cute duck named Duckalina that will encourage the user to take a 10 minute study/work break
* Press the ESC key as the study break timer is running to exit out of the break early
* Duck puns in the menu that will *quack* 😂 you up!
