## 💁 What is Beek-a-Boo? 

Beek-a-Boo is a Google Chrome extension that acts as a study break timer. The user inputs an amount of time they want to study for before taking a break. Once the timer reaches 00:00, a duck will come out of the side of the screen and sleep on the cursor! Users won’t be able to move their cursor for 10 minutes (unless they press the spacebar to end the break timer early). This encourages users to take a break from their screen and get active! 

## ⭐ Beek-a-Boo’s Features:
* A timer that counts down from some user-inputted amount of time
* A cool, cute duck named Duckalina that will encourage the user to take a 10 minute study/work break
* Press the spacebar as the study break timer is running to end the break early
* Duck puns in the menu that will *quack* 😂 you up!

## 🦆 How to Use Beek-A-Boo:
* Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store
* 📑 Bookmark the extension to your browser for easy access!
* Input an amount of time you plan to study for
* Click on the start timer button ✅ to start the study timer
* Once the study timer ends, the break timer will begin
* If you want to end your 10 minute break early, press [spacebar] to wake up Duckalina! 💤
